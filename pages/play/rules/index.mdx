The following is a guide to the rules we aim to adhere to. Generally we start slow and looser with interpretations then tighten up on calls as players warm up and play quickens.

## Players

6 players per side with unlimited subs. **During tournaments**, mixed Teams must have at least two females on the pitch at all times. However a team can play a legal game with 4 male and 1 female player.

## Attack

If you pick the ball up from the ground you must pass it on before somebody touches you.

- Don't drop the ball
- Don't pass the ball forward
- Don't put the ball down if nobody has touched you

To score a try

- Ball must be placed on or over the scoreline
- Ball does not have to be released to score a touchdown
- Dummy Half is not permitted to score touchdowns
- If a touch is made as the ball is being grounded - the touch counts
- If a touch occurs in the touchdown zone, play restarts 5 metres infield from the scoreline

## Turnovers

A change of possession occurs when

- the ball is dropped to the ground
- 6 touches have been defended
- a player runs out of bounds
- Dummy Half touched while in possession
- incorrect rollball, **off the mark**

At a change of possession, play restarts with a ROLLBALL

## Rollball

Position at the mark where the touch was made

- Face attacking scoreline
- Without delay, roll the ball backwards between the legs
- Dummy Half must pick up the ball cleanly and play without delay
- At the rollball, the Referee shall indicate the touch count

## Defence

It is **not rugby**, aim to use one hand and maintain a **light** touch.

- A touch can be affected by either a defending player or by the player in possession
- A touch counts on the ball, hair or clothing

## Penalties

Committed by the attacking team

- Forward pass
- Touch & pass
- Performing a rollball before being touched
- Performing a rollball off the mark
- Delaying play

Committed by the defending team.

- Using more than minimum force to effect a touch
- Claiming a touch when the touch was not affected
- Defender offside at rollball - 5-7 metres
- Defender offside at the tap - 10 metres
- Get back 5m or the try line

General infringements

- Playing more players than the allowable number
- Incorrect substitution
- Obstruction
- Misconduct

At a Penalty, play restarts with a TAP to the non-offending team.

## Tap Restart

- Ball must be placed on the ground at the mark
- Ball must be released from both hands
- Ball is tapped with either foot at a distance of not more than 1 metre
- Ball must be picked up cleanly

## Substitutions

- Subs can be made at any time from one side of the field.
- Substituting players must make contact with each other over the sideline.
