The aim of defence is to touch an attacker with the ball in possession before they can place it over the try line.

**Most importantly**, from the touch mark, you must **work hard to retreat 7 metres or to the try line** before you come forward to make another touch. Otherwise you will be penalised.

## General Tips

Good communication is essential for good defence. We come from all over the world and have varying experience playing touch rugby, so if someone is using terms you don't understand, don't hesitate to ask them to explain what they mean.

- Don't get caught ball watching.
- Don't sub until your team has the ball again.
- Use the subs often to stay fresh.

## Short vs Open Side

Knowing whether you are defending open or short helps to coordinate your defensive line.

## Shut Down Defence

This is a more complex strategy that prevents the attacking team from making easy metres while also conserving energy in your team.
