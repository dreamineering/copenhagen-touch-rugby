Touch Rugby is played between teams of 6 players each. **Wingers** stand nearest to either sideline with two **Middles** standing in the middle, between the Middles and the Wingers stand the **Links**.

Winger - Link - Middle - Middle - Link - Winger

### Middles

These are the workhorses.

On attack Middles are disciplined in using quick plays of the ball to eat as many yards as possible early in the touch count.

On defence Middles have biggest workload, providing cover for the other middle and their link player.

### Links

Links are generally the most elusive players with exceptional catch and pass skills.

### Wings

Wings should be the fastest players in the team.

On attack Wings use speed to finish opportunities and vision to run into space to create numeric advantages.

On defence shut down opposing break outs
